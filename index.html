          <p>"Generation Y/Millenials" are different from "Generation X" and will need new styles of communication from their managers if they are to perform well. What are the implications and what guidelines would you propose for managers to follow? What do companies who run graduate programmes do to help managers and new recruits handle the communication challenges?</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Executive Summary</h2>
          <p>
            This report analyzes the communication clashes between two generations, namely generation ‘X’ and ‘Y’. Its aim is to help provide managers with an understanding of new methods of communication. Methods of analysis include interviews to help examine and understand the relationship between manager and employees, whilst further secondary research was done to understand the underlying theories at work. The three main factors analyzed are job satisfaction, professionalism and work cohesion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Research showed that both generations had different values and standards of acceptability regarding these factors, which ultimately led to clashes in communication. As a result, managers have had to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Balance training costs with labour turnover</li>
            <li>Deliver employee feedback to meet “esteem needs”</li>
            <li>Formalize compensation packages</li>
            <li>
              Teach younger employees how to communicate nonverbally in professional manner
            </li>
            <li>
              Pay more attention to millennial input
            </li>
            <li>
              Allow for flexible working options
            </li>
            <li>
              Adopt unified communication platforms for instant real-time collaboration
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There is no sure-fire way of resolving these conflicts in communication between generations, but there are a range of strategies managers can employ to help alleviate the most common issues faced by many companies. These include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Communicating training procedures and job expectations early on in recruitment process
            </li>
            <li>
              Tailoring one-on-one feedback sessions according to age and personal characteristics
            </li>
            <li>
              Prohibiting employees from discussing compensation packages
            </li>
            <li>
              Implementing intergenerational partnerships and mentoring programs
            </li>
            <li>
              Educating millennials on proper non-verbal communication etiquette
            </li>
            <li>
              Encouraging both generations to share opinions during meetings
            </li>
            <li>
              Establishing clear authority among millennials
            </li>
            <li>
              Clarifying time commitment required for work projects
            </li>
            <li>
              Moving physical office locations closer to younger staff
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensuring in-person communication is not replaced altogether
            </li>
            <li>
              Keeping in mind the limitations that stereotypes pose
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It is imperative to realize that both generations must compromise to ensure a smooth channel of communication which will lead to their collective betterment.
